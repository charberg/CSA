Before running the program for the first time, the install.php file must be executed in the browser in order that the database be created. 
From there, the user may just navigate through the local host to the Main program folder. 
From here the index.php file will redirect the user to the first view page of the program.

In order to add more information to the database, the files within the data folder must be updated.
