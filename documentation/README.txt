David was in charge of all the front end which included all html and java code.

Project Folders:
Main folder:

Data Folder:
Holds all data (held in files) needed to create the database.

Documentation Folder:

Before running the program, for the first time. The install.php file must be executed in the browser in order that the database be created. From there, the user may just navigate through the local host to the Main program folder. From here the index.php file will redirect the user to the first view page of the program.
